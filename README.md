# NFT Contract for Solana

## Overview

This was built with the amazing help of the https://www.risein.com/ team. Thank you for your help and keep providing the amazing service you do.

This Solana NFT contract is designed to provide a simple and efficient way to create, transfer, and burn non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Solana blockchain. The contract includes three main functions: mint, transfer, and burn.

## Functions

### 1. Mint
Using the Solana NFT contract, minting a new token for the blockchain involves calling the mint function and providing the recipient's address along with the desired metadata. For example, to mint a unique artwork as an NFT and transfer it to a user with the address 0x123abc, the minting function would be invoked as follows:

### 2. Burn 
The burn function allows the owner of an NFT to permanently destroy their token. This might be useful in situations where the owner wants to remove the NFT from circulation.

### 3. Transfer
The transfer function enables users to send their NFTs to other addresses. Only the owner of a specific NFT can initiate a transfer.
